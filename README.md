# DFTS_TF2
Deep Feature Transmission Simulator (DFTS) - compatible with TensorFlow version 2.

Originally released in 2018 [[1]](#references), DFTS was developed to be compatible with Tensorflow version 1 (more specifically, version 1.12) and Keras 2.2.2. The demo paper [[2]](#references) gave a brief overview of the simulator. Various changes in Tensorflow 2 [[3]](#references) break the operation of DFTS. 

We have modified DFTS to be now fully Tensorflow version 2-compatible in this repository. Previously, we have edited the original DFTS to run (with minimal modification) in Tensorflow 2 by disabling the v2 behavior in [[4]](#references). For now on, we will focus our efforts on developing DFTS_TF2.
