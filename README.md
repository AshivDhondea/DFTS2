# DFTS2
Deep Feature Transmission Simulator (DFTS) version 2.

Originally released in 2018 [[1]](#references), DFTS was developed to be compatible with Tensorflow version 1 (more specifically, version 1.12) and Keras 2.2.2. The demo paper [[2]](#references) gave a brief overview of the simulator. Various changes in Tensorflow 2 [[3]](#references) break the operation of DFTS. 

We have modified DFTS to be now fully Tensorflow version 2-compatible in this repository. Previously we edited the original DFTS to run (with minimal modification) in Tensorflow 2 by disabling the v2 behavior in [[4]](#references). 

DFTS2 is a sophisticated simulation framework. It has new features:
1. TensorFlow version 2 compatibility.
2. Additional communication channel models and simulation modes.
3. Missing feature recovery methods from the recent literature.

## Publications
Two peer reviewed conference papers were published on work done with DFTS2.
* A. Dhondea, R. A. Cohen, and I. V.Bajić, [**CALTeC: Content-adaptive linear tensor completion for collaborative intelligence**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506372), Proc. IEEE ICIP, 2021.
* A. Dhondea, R. A. Cohen, and I.V.Bajić, **DFTS2: Deep feature transmission simulator for collaborative intelligence**.
For benchmarking purposes and to assist future users, we provide our packet traces, example simulation scripts and Monte Carlo experiment result files in a [Dropbox directory](https://www.dropbox.com/home/MEng_Project/dfts2). The full-scale test set used in our experiments is the same subset of the Imagenet validation set from the original DFTS demo paper [[1]](#references).

## Creating your environment
You can create a virtual environment using the requirements file.
